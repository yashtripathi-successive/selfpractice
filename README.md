key takeaways : 12 factor app

One codebase, many versions

Use one project in version control (like Git), but deploy it in many environments (dev, test, production).
Declare your tools

List all tools and libraries your app needs (like in package.json) so others can install them easily.
Store settings outside the code

Keep passwords, keys, and URLs in environment variables, not hardcoded in files.
Use external services like plug-ins

Treat databases, email services, etc., as separate services you can connect to.
Separate build and run steps

First build your app, then release, then run. Don’t mix them up.
Keep it stateless

Don’t store data or sessions in memory. Use databases or caches for that.
Run it on a port

Your app should listen on a port (like a website) so users can connect directly.
Scale with processes

Want to handle more users? Run more copies (processes) of your app.
Start fast, stop clean

Your app should start quickly and shut down safely, so it can be deployed easily.
Keep all environments similar

Make sure dev, testing, and production are as similar as possible to avoid bugs.
Stream logs

Just print logs to the screen


key takeaways : Atomic Design

- A methodology for creating design systems by breaking interfaces into smaller, reusable components.

- Five Stages of Atomic Design:

   Atoms:
     Basic building blocks like buttons, labels, inputs, colors, fonts.
     Example: A button or a text input field.

   Molecules:
     Groups of atoms working together as a unit.
     Example: A search form made of a text input + button.

   Organisms:
     Complex components made of groups of molecules and/or atoms.
     Example: A header with logo, navigation menu, and search form.

   Templates:
     Page-level structures that combine organisms to form layouts.
     Example: A page layout showing header, content area, and footer.

   Pages:
     Specific instances of templates with real content.
     Example: The homepage with actual text, images, and data filled in.

- Benifits

   Encourages reusability
   Maintains consistency
   Simplifies design and development
   Makes scaling UI easier

- Summary
   Build small reusable pieces → combine into bigger parts → compose full pages.
