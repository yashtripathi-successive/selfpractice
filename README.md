key takeaways : Atomic Design

- A methodology for creating design systems by breaking interfaces into smaller, reusable components.

- Five Stages of Atomic Design:

   Atoms:
     Basic building blocks like buttons, labels, inputs, colors, fonts.
     Example: A button or a text input field.

   Molecules:
     Groups of atoms working together as a unit.
     Example: A search form made of a text input + button.

   Organisms:
     Complex components made of groups of molecules and/or atoms.
     Example: A header with logo, navigation menu, and search form.

   Templates:
     Page-level structures that combine organisms to form layouts.
     Example: A page layout showing header, content area, and footer.

   Pages:
     Specific instances of templates with real content.
     Example: The homepage with actual text, images, and data filled in.

- Benifits

   Encourages reusability
   Maintains consistency
   Simplifies design and development
   Makes scaling UI easier

- Summary
   Build small reusable pieces → combine into bigger parts → compose full pages.
